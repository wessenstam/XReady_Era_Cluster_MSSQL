#Temp Workshop

Due to the not yet readily availability of AWS and HPOC in one RX and Runbook reservation, this workshop has been built.
This workshops starts with the explanation how to setup the environment so Era Clusters using multiple HPOC systems can be run.

TODO:
1. Build the setup part of the module
2. Make needed changes to the workshop modules
